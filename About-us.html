            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p> <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I hd so many things i thought that i loved, buut the truth was i couldn't appreciate any because there was too much</p>
            <p> Things were terrible. i had a jobb that i hated, a home that i didnt want to live in, and i couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

            <h3> How i tured things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was at the verge of breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of mypossessions in gthe garbage,and sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and i quit my job.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all. Everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what to do. But it worked out</p>

            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that i live the simple life, things are less stressful, I enjoy life and work more and hve more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p> With how much it turned my around, <strong>I felt like i had no choice but to share how i did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life too, which is why i  started this sitel</p>
